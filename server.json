      "background": "Geralt of Rivia, Eh? Well there’s a hero if I ever hearda one. Ya see witchers ain’t too highly thought of around these parts, but Geralt of Rivia’s different. Most witchers don’t get involved in our affairs. Just sorta pass through town, kill some monsters here and there then move on their way. Heh, hard to get to likin’ someone who only shows up to kill and leaves when the killin’s done. Geralt on the other hand, this whoreson’s name’s been on everybody’s tongues from Kovir to Nilfgaard. Name a major event in the last few decades and this guy’s probably been there. Fought at the battle of Brenna against the black ones, was part of the destruction of Stygga Castle in Nilfgaard — swear he’s either lookin’ for trouble or he’s the unluckiest man alive, heh. Last few years it’s been gettin’ worse. First off,the whorseon died! Aye, now that’s one hell of a trick ain’t it? Folks say Geralt of Rivia was killed in Rivia by some blighter named Rob. Course even that can’t keep this witcher down, and just a bit later he’s back huntin’ for a bunch of criminals who raided his home in the Blue Mountains. Leaves Geralt in Vizima where he’s gotta clean up the whole mutant mess Jaques De Aldersburg brought down on the city. Then, just last year, Geralt’s put on the block for the murder of King Foltest of Temeria, only to escape and go on a hunt for the real killer. Winds up at the summit at Loc Muinne where all hell breaks loose again. There’s a dragon and rebel mages, and the whole thing comes down to Geralt again. Guy can’t catch a break. Either way. Here he’s wanderin’ the North lookin’ for his lost lady love, Yennefer of Vengerburg and some lass with ashen hair. Wish the best of luck to him."

      "background": "Triss Merigold used to be the sorceress advisor to King Foltest of Temeria. Fine enough mage from everything I heard, but her real claim to fame’s her relationship with Geralt of Rivia and her connection to the Lodge of Sorceresses. S’pose we’ll get the easy part out of the way first, heh. Geralt’s had this long on-and-off-thing with Yennefer for years now and at some point, Triss, who’s Yennefer’s old school pal, gets warm for Geralt. Course Geralt’s pretty much Yennefer’s man over half the time, but to the whole rest of the world Geralt and Yennefer are a god calamity waitin’ to happen. So Triss thinks it won’t be too bad if she snags the witcher when he’s fed up with Yennefer and roamin’ the world. Seduction happens here and there, maybe a bit of magic, and now Geralt’s got Yennefer sometimes and Triss the other times. Don’t hurt that after his “death,” turns out Geralt’s got no memories of his past and so he winds up with Triss, since Yennefer’s gone or dead or what have ya. It’s all a nightmare waitin’ to happen, heh. But besides her romantic life it’s her connection to the Lodge of Sorceresses that sets this mage apart. Triss’s a skilled Magic mage — even made a spell, “Merigold’s Hailstorm”— and was part of the secretive cabal  of sorceresses that commited treason against the North. Now, she wasn’t in on the treason from what I know, but she’s got ties to all those lasses. Heard a rumor lately that she’s in Novigrad, gatherin’ up all the mages and students from Aretuza to head north for Kovir. Maybe after workin’ with the ones who put the Northern mages in danger she’s lookin’ to save the rest while she still can. Heh, hope so. Definitely some mages that need to die, but not all of ‘em."
