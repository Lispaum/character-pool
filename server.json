      "Background": "Geralt of Rivia, Eh? Well there’s a hero if I ever hearda one. Ya see witchers ain’t too highly thought of around these parts, but Geralt of Rivia’s different. Most witchers don’t get involved in our affairs. Just sorta pass through town, kill some monsters here and there then move on their way. Heh, hard to get to likin’ someone who only shows up to kill and leaves when the killin’s done. Geralt on the other hand, this whoreson’s name’s been on everybody’s tongues from Kovir to Nilfgaard. Name a major event in the last few decades and this guy’s probably been there. Fought at the battle of Brenna against the black ones, was part of the destruction of Stygga Castle in Nilfgaard — swear he’s either lookin’ for trouble or he’s the unluckiest man alive, heh. Last few years it’s been gettin’ worse. First off,the whorseon died! Aye, now that’s one hell of a trick ain’t it? Folks say Geralt of Rivia was killed in Rivia by some blighter named Rob. Course even that can’t keep this witcher down, and just a bit later he’s back huntin’ for a bunch of criminals who raided his home in the Blue Mountains. Leaves Geralt in Vizima where he’s gotta clean up the whole mutant mess Jaques De Aldersburg brought down on the city. Then, just last year, Geralt’s put on the block for the murder of King Foltest of Temeria, only to escape and go on a hunt for the real killer. Winds up at the summit at Loc Muinne where all hell breaks loose again. There’s a dragon and rebel mages, and the whole thing comes down to Geralt again. Guy can’t catch a break. Either way. Here he’s wanderin’ the North lookin’ for his lost lady love, Yennefer of Vengerburg and some lass with ashen hair. Wish the best of luck to him."
